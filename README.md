# Objective
This project aims to develop AI bots that would respond to human posts in a closed Facebook group using sentiment-analysis and Google Cloud NLP. The project is conducted at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor and is used for research purposes. Still under development currently.

# Note
Inspired by OpenAI's GPT2, we are currently extending our project to a neural network architecture by developing a model where we can train the bots to generate text based on human inputs (conversations) retrieved from the closed Facebook group.
